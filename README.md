## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with support for:
  - Web Speech API
  - Web Audio API
  - Fetch API
  - ES2020+ JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtualshop-ai.git
cd virtualshop-ai
```

2. Open with Python HTTP Server (recommended):
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or for Python 3.x
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Direct Usage
Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Building from TypeScript

If you want to compile the TypeScript source:

1. Install TypeScript:
```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

2. Compile:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or directly:
```bash
tsc app.ts --target ES2020 --module ES2020 --lib ES2020,DOM
```

## Configuration

### API Key
The application uses a Google Gemini API key. To use your own key:
1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Replace the `API_KEY` constant in `app.js` or `app.ts`

### Voice Language
Modify the `voiceConfig` object to change the language:
```javascript
const voiceConfig = {
    lang: 'en-US', // Change to other language codes
    rate: 1.0      // Speech rate (0.1 to 10)
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Recognition Not Working

## Performance Tips

1. **Caching**: Browser caches external libraries (Font Awesome, Tesseract.js)
2. **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when needed
3. **Minification**: CSS uses compact syntax for better performance
4. **Async Loading**: External libraries load asynchronously

- HTML escaping for user input
- Safe URL detection and validation
- No sensitive data stored locally
- HTTPS recommended for deployment

## Accessibility

- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Readable font sizes
- Semantic HTML structure

## Future Enhancements
